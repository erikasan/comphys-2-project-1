electric boogaloo

TODO for the theoretical part of the report:
- Describe the problem
- Trial Wave function
- Minor changes to the Hamiltonian
- Defining the actual process: Monte Carlo sampling from the trial wave function with help of the local energy
- Optimization

TODO for the annoying wave function:
- Make the wave function be zero when a single particle distance is below psi
- Some (intensive) testing
- Lots and lots (and lots) of optimization: Make the distance matrix 4D (x,y,z, total), make (maybe) a quantum force matrix. 
- Test if everything works. One way to test is to set a=0, which should return the original system.
- I have not yet written a single comment. Reminder to myself: Get drunk (to ease the pain), then write comments.

TODO Otherwise:
- The whole result part
- Introduction
- Abstract
- Add the derivations we have as pdf to the appendix
