I need to
- implement the (n-particle) wave function and Laplacian(s) (in the simple Gaussian wave function)
- implement the Initialization of particles: This is done in the randomuniform.cpp-file, where we need to create m_particles partices and
  that need to be given their position
- implement the metropolis Steps for the system. That means updating metropolisStep() and runMetropolisSteps.
- Implement the calculation of the local energy for the Hamiltonian (within the harmonic oscillator function)
